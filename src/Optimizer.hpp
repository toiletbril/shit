/* The analyze-time optimizer. The prepass calls into this unit to prove a fact
   about a node once, before any command runs, so the evaluator skips work on
   every later execution of that node. The unit is a small transformation-rule
   engine in the spirit of a Volcano/Cascades rewrite phase. The shell builds
   one plan rather than competing plans, so there is no cost model, only the
   rewrite half. Each optimization is a RULE, a match-and-rewrite over the arena
   AST that either annotates a node and reports it changed or leaves the node
   untouched. The driver applies the rules to a node in passes until no rule
   fires, a fixpoint, with a bounded iteration count so a buggy rule cannot
   loop. The node stores a rule's decision in its own cache field and the
   evaluator reads it, so this unit holds the algorithms and the rules and the
   nodes hold the storage and the dispatch. */

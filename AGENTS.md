# shit project notes

## Documentation ownership

Never modify README.md without explicit approval.

The runtime manual is docs/shit.1. It owns invocation, options, moods, shell
syntax, runtime behavior, builtins, interactive behavior, diagnostics,
environment variables, startup processing, and runtime files.

The configuration manual is docs/shit.5. It owns startup file identity and
file-format behavior. Startup files contain ordinary shell commands. Shell
language and runtime loading rules remain in docs/shit.1.

A new flag, mood, builtin, or renamed option updates AGENTS.md, docs/shit.1,
and completions/shit.bash. A configuration file change also updates docs/shit.5.
An architecture or contributor workflow change updates AGENTS.md.

The project is a C++ and C command shell. Speed is the defining goal. The
interactive editor is the vendored C submodule under src/toiletline.

## Build and install

The top-level Makefile delegates to src/Makefile. It supplies the configured
logical processor count when the caller does not select a parallel job count.

`make MODE=rel` writes the optimized binary to ./shit. `make MODE=dbg` writes
./shit-dbg with AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. `make MODE=cov`
writes ./shit-cov. The default mode is dbg.

A bare `make` builds the `shit` target from a clean checkout. The `shit` target
is the default goal. Object directories are order-only prerequisites. Prefer a
make target to a raw compiler invocation.
Use `make clean` to remove stale artifacts. Never remove ./shit directly. The
clean target removes the main binaries, object trees, and every Cosmopolitan
.dbg and architecture ELF sidecar.

The completion suite requires the debug binary because
`--debug-complete-at` is unavailable under NDEBUG. The README documents the
complete mode catalog, cross-compilation targets, and PREFIX installation.

## Test and golden workflow

Run `make -C test test` for the main and completion suites. Run
`make -C test bench` for the benchmark. Wrap an interactive launch in a timeout.

The `refill` target regenerates goldens. The REFILL variable limits regeneration
to named tests. Read every regenerated golden before accepting it. Refill
records the binary output without judging it.

The shit_tests, cli_tests, dashdiff, bashdiff, mimicrydiff, and bench recipes
live in scripts under test. POSIX hosts launch them with /bin/bash. Windows
launches them with sh. The shit_tests and cli_tests scripts accept test names.
A bare NAME target or cli_NAME target runs one test through the same script.
The dashdiff, bashdiff, and mimicrydiff scripts compare through process
substitution. The harness carries alternate goldens for documented macOS
differences.

The benchmark uses `+analysis` for analysis-enabled runs. Compatibility rows
retain their mood and enable analysis with `-W`.

Every rm test invokes the shitbox rm with `--dry-run`. This rule applies to
rm_behavior, rm_refuses_dot, rm_refuses_root, and every new rm test. Temporary
directory cleanup uses the system rm behind a `[ -n "$d" ]` guard. The shitbox
rm under test never performs cleanup.

The bashdiff and mimicrydiff comparisons require Bash 5.3 or newer. Both scripts
report a skipped comparison when BASHP names an older Bash. The macOS system
/bin/bash is Bash 3.2. Pass a modern Bash through BASHP on macOS.

## Code conventions

### Declarations and names

Use `let` and `let const`, the macros for `auto` and `const auto`, for deduced
locals. A literal counter such as `usize i = 0` keeps its explicit type because
`let i = 0` would deduce int. Functions use `fn name(...) throws -> ret`.

A null pointer comparison uses `== nullptr` or `!= nullptr`. Never use pointer
truthiness.

Names are verbose and semantic. A boolean begins with `is_`, `should_`, `was_`,
`did_`, or `has_`. A count ends in `_count`. A measured number ends in a suffix
such as `_length`, `_depth`, or `_position`. Never use a bare `n_` prefix. A
variable-bound lambda begins with `do_`. An accessor begins with `get_` or
`set_`.

Stray enums and structs use lower_snake_case. Classes, nested enums, and nested
types use CamelCase. File operations accept Path, never String or StringView.

### Comments and control flow

A clear name replaces a comment that explains an unclear name. A comment states
why the code has its current shape. C and C++ comments use `/* ... */`. Never
use `//`.

An if condition containing `&&` or `||` uses braces. A trivial single-condition
if omits braces. Blank lines separate logical blocks. Place a blank line before
and after a loop, before a return, and after a declaration group.

Three or more name comparisons use a static table. A hot leading-byte dispatch
uses a switch. A static dispatch table uses `consteval StaticStringMap` and SSK
keys.

### State and reuse

Per-executor state passes through EvalContext and constructors. The codebase has
no mutable global for per-executor state.

Search for an existing function, parser, or helper before implementing new
logic. Reuse the existing mechanism. New abstractions, file splits, file merges,
and dependency upgrades require approval.

## Architecture

### Front end and evaluation

src/Main.cpp parses flags, runs the startup chain, and drives scripts or the
interactive loop. src/Lexer.cpp creates tokens. src/Parser.cpp creates the
syntax tree. src/Optimizer.cpp folds constants and removes dead branches during
analysis.

A C-style for loop whose condition folds to zero is removed only when its init
clause is empty. A nonempty init clause runs once before the condition.

Owned shell source normalizes CRLF pairs before lexing, analysis, evaluation,
and diagnostics. Named files, standard input, command strings, sourced text,
and executable fallback use the same normalization. A lone carriage return
remains data.

Evaluation is divided among src/Eval.cpp and the Eval-prefixed files. These
files own substitution, word expansion, parameter expansion, globbing,
arithmetic, arrays, source, jobs, and functions. src/Expressions.cpp owns the
command node base and analysis hooks. src/ExpressionsSimpleCommand.cpp owns
simple commands. src/ExpressionsCompound.cpp owns lists, pipelines, loops,
case, and compound commands. src/ExpressionsArith.cpp owns arithmetic and
logical nodes. Shared free helpers are declared in
src/ExpressionsInternal.hpp.

The builtins live under src/builtins. The bundled utilities live under
src/shitbox. Every builtin remains enabled. The enable `-d`, `-n`, `-f`, and
`-s` flags are accepted without effect. The `-a` flag lists every builtin.

### Runtime state

MimicMood.hpp owns `parse_mood_name` and `mood_name`. The flag parser,
`set --mood`, and `set --init-moods` use that table.

RuntimeState owns the mood, diagnostic controls, explicit strictness marks, and
shell option bits. Capture and restore copy the complete state. The set builtin
uses one descriptor table for mutation, queries, help, completion, SHELLOPTS,
and `$-`. Its compile-time name map retains binary search.

`apply_strictness_for_mood` owns mood strictness. An explicit nounset, pipefail,
or failglob setting survives a mood change. `command_word_is_glob` owns the
command-position glob check. The runtime diagnostic levels distinguish
`force-warnings`, `force-diagnostics`, and `no-diagnostics`.

Restricted behavior uses one shared context state. Variable changes, directory
changes, slash-bearing command and source operands, output redirections, exec,
command `-p`, enable loading, history paths, and hash `-p` read that state.

Eval snapshots also retain shopt state, the directory stack, the working
directory reference, and the file creation mask. An in-process subshell restores
the complete snapshot.

Sparse indexed array names are tracked separately. Resetting a dense array does
not scan unrelated sparse entries. A one-element PIPESTATUS update reuses its
dense slot.

### Jobs and process execution

An asynchronous pipeline job owns every stage process. POSIX stages share one
process group. The final stage remains primary for `$!`, status, and job output.
Polling, waiting, foregrounding, backgrounding, signaling, and disowning retain
or reap earlier stages. A stopped event from any retained stage remains stored.
The wait builtin returns the first stored stopped status without waiting for
that process again. The fg and bg builtins resume every retained stage.

A process-group reference retained for timeout remains valid after polling
closes the leader. `close_process_group` releases the retained platform handle.
An interactive timeout child waits behind a start pipe until its process group
owns the controlling terminal.

Forked evaluators report the current process through BASHPID. `$$` retains the
original shell process.

Executable-format fallback uses an explicit invalid-process result. A fresh
evaluator receives the command environment and argument zero. Caller variables,
functions, and traps are excluded. Each complete top-level command runs before
the next command is parsed. Terminal execution begins only after the lexer
reaches the literal end of source.

The main shell ignores SIGPIPE. A forked child restores the default action.

### Platform boundary

src/Platform.cpp routes the operating system implementation. POSIX targets use
PlatformPosix.cpp as the base and PlatformPosixExtra.cpp for Linux and Darwin
overlays. Windows uses PlatformWin32.cpp. Cosmopolitan flags are registered by
the POSIX implementation.

Platform.hpp owns platform headers. Every platform call and platform type is
hidden behind an os wrapper. A non-platform source contains no syscall, platform
header, or platform macro.

`read_fd` reports a closed pipe as EOF on every implementation. The shared
`get_processor_counts` wrapper supplies the affinity-limited and configured
logical processor counts used by shitbox nproc.

Fork-backed evaluator launches pass through os wrappers. POSIX evaluates the
inherited syntax tree in the child. Windows selects an in-process fallback or
starts a fresh shell from recorded source. When Windows cannot fork a piped
evaluator, a context-independent builtin or valid shitbox utility starts as a
fresh shell stage. Platform flags and runtime initialization also pass through
os wrappers.

On Windows, a background process receives a fresh console process group without
a Job Object. Successful virtual-terminal initialization enables editor
decorations without requiring TERM.

### Completion and editor

src/Completion.cpp drives completion. src/CompletionManpage.cpp and
src/CompletionScan.cpp own their scans. src/CompletionHighlight.cpp owns the
per-keystroke highlighter. src/CompletionInternal.hpp declares shared helpers.
src/CompletionPolicy.hpp owns program policies, help allowlists, extension
hints, custom completer routing, and transparent prefixes.

Completion isolates the command segment at the cursor. The scanner is quote
aware, recognizes the innermost command substitution, stops before its closer,
and skips here-document bodies. The cascade checks process arguments, builtin
flags, registered specifications, build targets, manual subcommands and options,
help subcommands and options, then the filesystem.

Smart-case and subsequence matching follow exact-prefix ranking. Ghost
completion stops after prefix matches. Explicit Tab also considers subsequences.
Empty ghost completion avoids a PATH scan. Empty explicit completion includes
PATH programs.

Path completion expands a leading tilde or variable prefix only for directory
listing. The offered candidate retains the typed prefix. Glob patterns expand
to their matches. Quote reconstruction preserves raw bytes before a quote and
appends the suffix inside the same quote. Completion replaces a stale suffix
after the cursor.

A command runs `--help` at most once per cache key. The program must pass the
allowlist and trusted-directory gate. The subcommand walk stops at a flag, an
unknown subcommand, or MAX_SUBCOMMAND_DEPTH of four.

Completion, highlighting, and command lookup share the directory-listing cache.
The first use in an epoch validates metadata. Later uses in that epoch reuse the
entry. Each interactive input starts an epoch. Tab and compgen start nested
explicit validation epochs. A stale command index is rebuilt after
PROMPT_COMMAND and before the editor accepts a key. Explicit PATH validation
ends with the Tab callback or compgen invocation that started it.

The runnable-name and regular-file indexes derive from directory listings.
They never populate the execution hash. Only execution and the hash builtin
populate that hash. A PATH membership change invalidates both indexes and the
execution hash. Each directory listing is sorted once by folded name.
Filesystem completion and partial-path highlighting binary-search the active
prefix. Symlink target kinds are resolved when a listing is used.

The highlighter probes a complete bare path without enumerating siblings. Warm
command and history classification performs no filesystem access. Variable
lookup is limited to names present on the line. Nested command and arithmetic
substitutions are colored in one pass.

Completion, diagnostics, and shitbox cat share semantic highlight roles and the
tolerant lexical scanner. Colors.cpp maps roles to terminal styles. Styled
underline support remains behind a disabled capability gate.

Diagnostic highlighting stores lexical checkpoints at line boundaries near
4096-byte intervals. Sequential lines build the same checkpoints without
copying their lexical containers. Checkpoints retain function definitions.
Random lookup resumes at the nearest checkpoint. A source identity change
invalidates checkpoints and cached spans.

src/Toiletline.cpp connects the editor and evaluator. The vendored editor lives
in src/toiletline/toiletline.h. The completion bridge retains its result until
the editor consumes returned pointers. Plain appends update the stored byte
length and serialized line directly. History entries are decoded as bytes.
Display width is tracked separately.

Ghost completion and history cache prefixes that produce no suggestion. The
physical working directory is captured once per input. Reassigning PWD does not
change the implicit completion base. A directory change preserves the command
cache when every PATH component is absolute. A relative or empty component
invalidates it.

### Diagnostics and source locations

src/Errors.cpp renders located carets and trailing notes. Diagnostic identifiers
live in src/Diagnostics.hpp. A type whose name contains WithLocation owns or
inherits a source location. A type whose name contains WithDetails owns a
trailing note. The semantic classes remain separate for catch routing.
ErrorWithLocationAndDetails may store a second location.

`relocate_error` wraps an unlocated error with a span and retains its details.
Word segment locations survive parameter modifiers, array subscripts,
arithmetic expressions, and nested substitutions. A contiguous here-document
retains its body location. A tab-stripped here-document has no source mapping.

Source traces are attached by eval, command substitution, function
substitution, and process substitution. A frame is printed once while its source
frame remains live. Several `-c` roots retain the source that produced each
message. Diagnostics and LINENO share one cached source line index. Cached
highlight spans use heap storage and survive highlighter arena resets. Display
width and clipping consume borrowed source views.

Directory builtins route every directory change through cd. The directory stack
lives on EvalContext. Logical PWD and OLDPWD are maintained in one place.
Missing paths retain the first unavailable component for the diagnostic span.

### Builtins and utilities

The assimilate transaction copies the running executable through scp. The
remote transaction uses explicit shitbox utilities. The remote login shell must
be POSIX-compatible and able to start the transferred executable.

The candidate SHA-256 identity must match the local executable. A keeper process
holds the transaction lock until the child exits, including after its launcher
exits. A later transaction recovers published and orphaned journals. A handled
failure restores the prior file or symlink and removes transaction files. A
failure before bootstrap cannot alter the installed target. An unusable partial
upload may remain.

`scripts/shit-scp` is a compatibility wrapper for assimilate.

SHIT_IDENTITY is a read-only exported dynamic variable. Its lowercase SHA-256
value is computed once on first read or before a child starts. An inherited
value is removed before evaluation begins.

The shitbox cat highlighter selects recognized shell extensions and shebangs.
It is suppressed for null bytes and redirected output. Line numbering remains
continuous across file and standard input boundaries. Highlighting emits no
underline attributes.

## Value types and allocation

Small types live in lightweight headers. MimicMood.hpp owns mimic_mood.
RuntimeState.hpp owns RuntimeState. NameValueArg.hpp owns NameValueArg and its
`from` factory.

A factored data structure lives directly in the shit namespace. A factored
class method is defined inline in its header. A free helper whose receiver is a
value type becomes a method on that type. Existing examples include
`StringView::is_all_decimal_digits`, `String::replace`, and
`Path::read_entire_file`.

`ArrayList::find` returns `Maybe<usize>`. Membership checks use
`find().has_value()`. Logic shared by POSIX and Windows lives in Utils.cpp.

ArrayList allocates nothing during default construction and grows
geometrically. String has a small inline buffer and grows geometrically. A
scratch arena uses mark and release lifetime within one scope.

WordSegment overlays its source position with its folded arithmetic result. A
folded segment clears its source length. A source-bearing segment clears the
folded-result tag. The 64-bit layout is 160 bytes.

## Logging

The log macros live in src/Trace.hpp. `LOG(level, fmt, ...)` prints at or below
the active verbosity. `LOG_VARS` prints named variables. The levels are Nothing,
Info, Debug, and All. Both macros compile out of a release build.

The executable logging and optimizer flags are documented in docs/shit.1.

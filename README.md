# Shit

Revolutionary command line interpreter of a custom scripting language, or an
interactive shell based on
[toiletline](https://github.com/toiletbril/toiletline) written in C++17. This
program was made as a late april fools joke and everything is written from
scratch, so use it at your own risk.

There will be more information soonâ„¢ (when I feel like it).

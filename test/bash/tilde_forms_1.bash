# The accepted alternative for tilde_forms.bash on a bash that expands a bare ~
# to the real home rather than the HOME the script sets, the macOS system bash
# 3.2 among them. shit follows POSIX and uses the assigned HOME, so the three
# bare-tilde lines are spelled as their literal expansion here, while the rest
# stay dynamic since shit and that bash agree on them.

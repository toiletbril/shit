# Option completion from a command's --help text passes two gates. The command
# is on shit's allowlist of commands safe to fork, and it resolves into a
# directory the current user or root owns that is not writable by group or
# other. A fake binary named for an allowlisted command (act) drives the
# probe deterministically. The same binary under a name shit does not recognize,
# or in a world-writable directory, is never forked.

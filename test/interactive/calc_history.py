"""The interactive calc prompt keeps its own history file.

A calc session swaps the editor history to the calc file on entry and back on
leave, so a shell command never lands in the calc file and a calc expression
never lands in the shell file. Both files are named through the environment, so
the session never reaches the real home directory.

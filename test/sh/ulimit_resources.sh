# ulimit reads resource limits and the -a table, checked against dash. The
# values come from the same kernel, so shit and dash report the same numbers.
# The -u flag is a bash-style alias the test avoids, since dash has none.

# The core limit is pinned to a known value first, since shit drops it to zero at
# startup as a courtesy while dash inherits whatever the environment carried, so
# without pinning the coredump line would differ by environment rather than by a
# real shell difference.

# Inline glob completion (echo *<TAB>) shell-quotes each expanded filename, so a
# name with a space, parens, a glob character, a backtick, a dollar, a double
# quote, a bang, or a single quote inserts as valid shell input. The preferred
# order is single quotes, then double quotes when the name holds a single quote.
# A backtick, dollar, and double quote are escaped inside the double-quote form,
# while a bang stays literal since shit has no history expansion.

# A set --init-moods inside ~/.shitrc must not recurse into the same flavor and
# overflow the stack, and the nested bash source must reuse the live arena rather
# than reset it under the tree being evaluated, which would dangle that tree's
# nodes. The shell sources the rc once, then exits because the /dev/null stdin is
# not a terminal. The exit status is what proves there was no crash, since a
# stack overflow or a corrupted arena raises a signal and exits 139 or 134
# rather than the clean non-terminal status. The ~/.bashrc carries an array
# assignment, the construct that tripped the arena corruption.
